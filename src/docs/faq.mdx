<!-- FAQ Question 1 -->

<button class="accordion">
  <strong>Are Excel files (.xlsx or any variants ) going to be supported?</strong>
</button>
<div class="panel">

<h4>At this time, we do not plan to add support for Excel file formats.</h4>

However, in the event a third-party vendor has supplied you with an .xlsx/xls file and you would like to use that file as the basis of a custom template, it is easy to save a copy of the Excel file as a .csv.

In Microsoft Excel, this operation can be completed with the following steps:

1. With the Excel file open, click **File > Save As**
2. In the **File Format** dropdown, select **CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (.csv)**

After completing this operation, you will receive a warning of possible data loss. The data being stripped away in this instance is file metadata that cannot be read by Quick Product Import.

<!-- FAQ Question 2 -->

<button class="accordion">
  <strong>Why wasn't I charged for my full upload?</strong>
</button>
<div class="panel">

#### You may notice an upload charge that is lower than you expected.

This may occur in the rare event that Quick Product Import's server has a minor hiccup during your upload. If this happens, the full extent of your upload will be carried out, but your charges will not reflect the total upload count.

In your Audit Log, the verified upload total will still be accurate.

<!-- FAQ Question 3 -->

<button class="accordion">
  <strong>Why is it recommended to use image links that are generated by my Shopify file storage?</strong>
</button>
<div class="panel">

#### Shopify saves any images on your .CSV to your store files.

If you provide a source link to an image that exists on another website, there may be an issue saving the image to your store during the bulk upload process. This can result in products that are uploaded without all the images you provided in your .csv spreadsheet.

It is strongly recommended to follow the best practice of uploading your images directly to your store's file storage before doing uploads that include the images you are using.
