## Are Excel files (.xlsx or any variants ) going to be supported?

At this time, we do not plan to add support for Excel file formats.

However, in the event a third-party vendor has supplied you with an .xlsx/xls file and you would like to use that file as the basis of a custom template, it is easy to save a copy of the Excel file as a .csv.

In Microsoft Excel, this operation can be completed with the following steps:

1. With the Excel file open, click **File > Save As**
2. In the **File Format** dropdown, select **CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (.csv)**

After completing this operation, you will receive a warning of possible data loss. The data being stripped away in this instance is file metadata that cannot be read by Quick Product Import.
