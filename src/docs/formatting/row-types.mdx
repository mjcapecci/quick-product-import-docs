Every import spreadsheet is divided into groups of three different row types. These row types are joined together to accomodate multiple variants and images per "base product".

| Type         | Description                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base Product | A row that creates a new product in your Shopify inventory |
| Image        | A row that adds an image to the base product above it      |
| Variant      | A row that adds a variant to the base product above it     |
