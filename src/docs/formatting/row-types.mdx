Every import spreadsheet is divided into groups of three different row types. These row types are joined together to accomodate multiple variants and images per "base product".

| Type         | Description                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base Product | A row that creates a new product in your Shopify inventory |
| Image        | A row that adds an image to the base product above it      |
| Variant      | A row that adds a variant to the base product above it     |

## Base Product Row

A base product row represents a complete product listing within your Shopify inventory. Your spreadsheet can be formatted to add images and variants onto a base product.

### What is a "Base Variant"?

Shopify's inventory options require merchants to handle data such as product SKU and inventory quantity at the variant level. This means that, in the event you are uploading a product that has no variants, a base variant will exist to manage variant-level data on your base product.

**If a product has no variants**, the base product row will function as the base variant.

**If a product has one or more variants**, the base product row will function as the first variant.

#### Possible Fields for Base Product Rows

Base product rows are identified as rows that contain values for the **Handle** and **Title** fields. Base product rows should also contain values for variant-level data as they will either function as a base variant, or the first variant where applicable.

## Image Row

An image row adds an image to its base product at the time of upload. An image row will always be associated with the nearest base product row above it.

**Note:** To link images to specific variants, an image must first be added to the base product via an image row.

#### Possible Fields for Image Rows

| Image Src            | Required     |

Image rows are indentified as having <u>**only**</u> an **Image Src** and, optionally, an **Image Alt Text** value.

## Variant Row

A variant row adds a variant to its base product at the time of upload. A variant row will always be associated with the nearest base product row above it.
