Spreadsheet templates are the tools through which Quick Product Import becomes powerful. Spreadsheet freedom is and usability is also an area that Quick Product Import aims to provide a uniquely effective experience.

## Default Template

Text about the default template, and the ability to download it.

<SampleSpreadsheet />
<DefaultTemplate />

## Template Creation

On the home page of the app, merchants have the ability to create and download a custom template. This feature may be useful if your products do not require the full list of field headers that appear on the default template. By downloading a custom template, you can deal only with the required fields and any optional fields that you desire to work with.

## Adding Data to Your Spreadsheet

Once you have downloaded the sample spreadsheet or the blank template, you have created your own template, or you are using a totally custom spreadsheet, adding data occurs by adding: **Base Product Rows**, **Image Rows**, and **Variant Rows** to the spreadsheet. To understand more about how these rows work with eachother, see [row types](/formatting/row-types)

## Metafield Support

Including columns with custom header values will result in the ability to create a custom metafield mapping. Continue to [metafields](/formatting/metafields) to learn more.
