The Invoice Window appears directly before an upload begins. Depending on your app settings, this window can appear from the Drop screen, the Mapping screen, or the Verify Import screen.

From the Invoice Window, several key pieces of billing and usage information are displayed.

## Upload Cost

The Invoice Window displays the cost of the upload that will occur when a merchant accepts charges. These charges will be added to the merchant's existing usage plan.

See the [pricing](/pricing) page for more information on billing in Quick Product Import.

## Usage Stats

Additionally, merchant's will be able to view their monthly usage statistics on their current billing plan.

If an upload will push a merchant beyond the capacity of their current usage plan, the merchant will be prompted to visting the [settings](/features/settings) page to upgrade their usage plan.

## After Accepting Charges

When a merchant agrees to the cost of an upload, the app will advance to the [Upload Timer Screen](/features/upload-timer).

**Note:** When a new upload is initiated, the ability to revert any prior upload is lost.
