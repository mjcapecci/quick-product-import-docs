After dropping a .CSV file into the drop zone on the landing page, the mapping screen will occur automatically in the following scenarios:

- The selected .CSV file **does not contain all required** header values
- The selected .CSV file contains **unknown** header values

## Custom Header Values

The main benefit of the mapping feature is the ability to map your own headers, and the values found in their associated columns, to field names that are expected by Quick Product Import. This allows great flexibility in creating custom mappings that make sense for your store.

## Creating and Saving Mappings

When you arrive on the mapping page, you will have the option to align your custom headers with a list of the required and optional headers available in Quick Product Import. You will be allowed to advance beyond the mapping page once you have accomodated all required header field values.

By default, **all unknown header values** will be classified as standard metafields until the merchant updates the field values.

### Saving Mappings

Merchants are allowed to save up to **10** custom mappings.

After you have made changes on the mapping screen, you will have the option to save your current mapping before advancing. Before saving your current mapping, you must also give it a name so that you can reference that saved mapping in a future upload.

In future uploads, saved mappings will present a percentage score in which they align with the selected .CSV file you are attempting to upload.

### Updating Mappings

A saved mapping can be updated at any time. Once on the mapping screen, and after selecting a mapping, your changed to either the mappings header configurations or name can be updated and saved in place of previous settings.

## Mapping Metafields

As covered in the [metafield section](../formatting/metafields), the mapping screen provides merchants with the option to create configurations that will upload metafield data. Along with other settings and mappings, these metafield configurations will also be saved when merchants save a new mapping. This makes it very convenient to re-use personalized spreadsheets with metafield mappings between uploads.
