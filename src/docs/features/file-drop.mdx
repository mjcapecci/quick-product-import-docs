The first step to importing and uploading inventory with Quick Product Import is by utilizing the drop zone on the home page of the app.

## Working with .CSV Files

Quick Product Import accepts only .CSV files. The drop zone accepts one file at a time. The drop zone will present an error if either of these conditions are not met.

### After Successful File Drop

Once Quick Product Import successfully parses your .CSV file, the app will advance to either:

- The [Mapping Screen](/features/mapping) (if applicable)
- The [Verify Import](/features/verify-import) screen (if applicable)
- The [Invoice Window](/features/invoice-window)

The screen your app will advance to is based on the details of your imported file and your saved [app settings](/features/settings).

### Other Errors

After dropiing a .CSV file, there are a number of errors that Quick Product Import will detect that will prevent merchants from advancing. If this should occur, details of the error will be presented in a banner above the drop zone. In many cases, the exact line of the spreadsheet on which the error occurs will be reported.
