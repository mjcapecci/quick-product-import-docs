---

The files generated and accepted by Quick Product Import are in the .CSV (comma-separated values) format.

We recommend having a program installed on your computer that makes editing .CSV files easy. One such program is [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel).

Other recommended options include (but are not limited to):

1. [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers/) (for MacOS users)
2. [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)
3. [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/)

**Note:** If you are using a Chrome extension, or an extension of any other browser, to open and edit your file, you may be required to do so in a **regular** browser window (meaning: not in incognito mode).
