The below is a list of recommended practices to ensure the best possible experience while using Quick Product Import.

<!-- Troubleshooting 1 -->

  <strong>Uploading Images</strong>

#### Working with Images in Quick Product Import

Shopify and Quick Product Import accept product images in the form of image links (the **"Image Src"** field on your .CSV).

It is a best practice to populate this field with links that are generated by uploading your images to your store's file storage.

To do so:

1. Click on **Settings** on the bottom-left of your store Admin Panel
2. Click on **Files**
3. Upload any images that will be used on your spreadsheet
4. Copy the links of the uploaded images to the corresponding rows on your spreadsheet

**Note:** It is _not recommended_ to upload third-party image links directly from your spreadsheet.

<!-- Troubleshooting 2 -->

<button class="accordion">
  <strong>Verifying Uploads</strong>
</button>
<div class="panel">

#### After an Upload, it is Recommended to Verify All Uploads

To do so:

1. Click on **Products** on the left-hand navigation bar in your Admin Panel
2. Click on the **Sort** button near the top-right corner
3. In the Sort dropdown, select Sort by **Created (newest first)**.

Your products should now be sorted in a way that is easy to compare to the spreadsheet you used for upload.
